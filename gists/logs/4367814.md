<h2 align=center>Log #2 Â· <code>facegrep</code> â€“ my first Rust program ðŸš€</h2>

Last week (Nov 4, 2022) I wrote my first Rust program, [facegrep](https://github.com/wzulfikar/facegrep). It's a command line program that detects a face from an image:

1. Let's use the test image at assets/test/scientists.jpg
2. Pass the test image to the command line: `facegrep assets/test/scientists.jpg`
3. The command found 29 faces and created a new image at assets/test/scientists.jpg-facegrep.png
4. Let's see the image and we'll see the red squares on each face
5. Now, let's use the command to output json instead of image: `facegrep assets/test/scientists.jpg --json | jq`
6. The command will show the array of face data (`bbox` and `score`) in json format

**Here's how I got the idea.**

I was checking twitter and saw [a tweet from @levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1588228588893077504):

and I thought, _"maybe I can do it in Rust? Maybe someone has done the algorithm and I only need to port it to Rust?"_. After a quick search, I found about [Rustface](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/rustface) which fits the bill: it detects face, doesn't require GPU, no external dependencies (eg. dlib, opencv). In fact, it's a port of C++ library [Seetaface](https://github.com/seetaface/SeetaFaceEngine) which is a face recognition engine.

I started digging Rustface codebase and felt like I'am profiting from my learning: I know where to start my digging (I started from [`src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/rustface/blob/master/src/lib.rs)), how the type system works, and most importantly I wasn't afraid of looking at the codes. The codebase was modular so I know it's not going to be heavy work to just wrap the library in a command line.

I used [examples/image_demo.rs](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/rustface/blob/master/examples/image_demo.rs) as starting point. It detects faces from the test image and draw red boxes on each face, so I only need to:

1. Change the test image to use the image from command line argument
2. Add option to output json

You'll see the final code in [main.rs](https://github.com/wzulfikar/facegrep/blob/main/src/main.rs) file of the facegrep repo. As you may have noticed, I didn't actually do a lot of work. It was mostly reorganizing the existing code to fit my need. Nevertheless, it was a good exercise to practice what I learnt.

- _Do I want to learn even more Rust after this exercise?_
    Yes, definitely. I was able to pick random repository (ie. Rustface) and figure out  what it does. Rust codebase is no longer something scary to look at.
- _Should I continue learning from the same resource, with the same style?_
    Yes, I should. From this exercise, I've seen that the knowledge I gained from the resources (see [Log #1](https://gist.github.com/wzulfikar/5ea5779d7f2ea0e27809e94e7904f93d?permalink_comment_id=4356995#gistcomment-4356995)) has materialized easily in real use case.

That's it! I think I'm on the right path. Looking forward to learning more Rust ðŸ¦€
