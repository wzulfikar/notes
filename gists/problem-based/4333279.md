|**🧶 Problem:**| Need a quick way to enable syntax highlighting in `nano`. |
|**💡 Solution**:| `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scopatz/nanorc/master/install.sh \| sh` |

**Context**:  
I was editing a file in Raspberry PI with `nano` and I realised that I actually had to do it multiple times. So I think having a syntax highlighter can add quality of life. After some googling, I found the repo in ref (https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc) and it actually has a one-liner command to add the syntax highlighting (see "Solution"). Note that the one-liner execute the script immediately to your shell. Depending on your situation, you might not want to do that (eg. if you don't trust the script).
