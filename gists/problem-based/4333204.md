|**🧶 Problem:**|Must download 20GB of xcode just to use `clang` or `make` |

**Context**:  
I wanted to install tfjs-node (`npm i @tensorflow/tfjs-node`) but it kept asking for `clang` and `make`. I googled around and followed the steps that eventually asked me to install XCode. But it was too big (20GB!) and it doesn't feel logical to me. I google around again and found the SO comment in ref. Tried it, and it works.
