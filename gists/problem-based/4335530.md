**Context**:  
Usually, I'd run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` in my laptop to see (and copy) my public SSH key. But turns out I can get the public key from https://github.com/wzulfikar.keys if I've added it to my Github account. Handy if I need to setup a new dev machine or a server.

Here's a one-liner to show your SSH public key using Github:

```sh
curl https://github.com/{username}.keys
```
