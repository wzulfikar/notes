<h2 align=center>Small Details âœ¨</h2>

There are small things I do quite often that I end up making a workflow around it. Here they are.

1. **Alias `localhost` to `l`.**
  I often type `localhost:3000` in my browser when doing local development so I think it'll help if I make it faster. I added `127.0.0.1 l` to my /etc/hosts file so I can just type l:3000 (much shorter!) in my browser, in terminal (eg. `curl l:3000/api`), etc.

2. **Make git commands shorter**
  I often run git commands so I want to make it shorter. I made [aliases](https://gist.github.com/wzulfikar/87b13c0bec3681e6dafdc76416e1cb8a#file-aliases-L20-L32) so I can type `push`, `pull`, `co`  instead of `git push`, `git pull`, `git checkout`. 

3. **Short commit message for minor, irrelevant changes**
  I often commit changes not directly related to the main goal of the PR but still count toward the work (eg. formatting, fix typos). I know the change is not interesting by itself and I know that I can still add comment in the PR if needed. For such commits, I use short message `f`. Combined with short git command from previous point, I can quickly push commit with `commit -m f`.

4. **Make shorter command when there's a pattern**
  I often use git and docker from command line and having some UI in terminal is very helpful, so I use [`lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) and [`lazydocker`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker). I saw the pattern (`lazy*`) and wrote [more aliases](https://gist.github.com/wzulfikar/87b13c0bec3681e6dafdc76416e1cb8a#file-aliases-L11-L12) to make it shorter: `lgit`, `ldocker`.
